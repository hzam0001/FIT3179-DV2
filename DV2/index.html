          The evolution and diversification of space exploration from <strong>1957 to 2020</strong> reveals how <strong>Russia</strong> (including Soviet Union) and the <strong>USA</strong> have dominated throughout the entire period, with <strong>1,395 and 1,344 missions</strong> respectively, reflecting their <strong>Cold War rivalry</strong> and sustained commitment to space programs. A notable trend is <strong>Kazakhstan's</strong> surprisingly high mission count of 701, largely attributed to the <strong>Baikonur Cosmodrome's</strong> role as the primary Soviet and Russian launch facility.
        </p>
        <p>
            The timeline shows a clear expansion pattern: the space race began as an exclusive superpower competition in the late 1950s, with <strong>France</strong> joining as the first non-superpower participant in the <strong>mid-1960s</strong>. The 1970s and 1980s saw gradual participation from additional nations including <strong>China, Japan, and India</strong>, marking the beginning of space exploration's democratization.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most significant <strong>diversification</strong> occurred from the <strong>1990s</strong> onward, with numerous countries and entities entering the field, including developing nations like <strong>Kenya</strong>. This shift reflects technological advancement, reduced costs, and the <strong>commercialization</strong> of space activities. By <strong>2020</strong>, over <strong>twenty countries</strong> had participated in space missions, transforming what was once an exclusive domain of superpowers into a global endeavor.

          The success rates of space missions vary significantly across countries, reflecting their experience, technological capabilities, and investment in space programs. The United States and Russia (including the Soviet Union) have launched the most missions, with both countries achieving success rates above 90%. This demonstrates the maturity and reliability of their space programs developed over decades of continuous operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          China has shown remarkable improvement in recent years, with a high success rate that reflects its growing expertise in space technology. Countries like France, Japan, and India have also demonstrated strong capabilities with consistent success rates, while smaller programs in Kazakhstan and Australia represent emerging or specialized space activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Space mission costs have evolved dramatically over the decades, with the Cold War era seeing massive investments from the USA and Russia. The logarithmic scale reveals how mission costs vary by orders of magnitude, from relatively modest launches to multi-billion dollar programs. The end of the Cold War in 1991 marked a significant shift in spending patterns, with a broader distribution of space activities across multiple nations and a diversification of mission types and objectives.

          The success rates of the top six most-used launch vehicles demonstrate the remarkable reliability achieved in modern spaceflight. These rockets represent decades of engineering refinement and operational experience, with each having launched numerous missions throughout their service life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the most frequently used launch vehicles, success rates generally exceed 90%, reflecting the stringent testing, quality control, and continuous improvement processes employed by space agencies and commercial operators. The slight variations in success rates often correlate with the rocket's age, complexity, and the types of missions undertaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Older, proven designs like the Soyuz family have demonstrated exceptional reliability through thousands of launches, while newer vehicles show how modern engineering and manufacturing techniques have enabled high success rates even early in their operational history. The donut chart visualization makes it easy to compare the performance of these workhorse vehicles that form the backbone of global space access.
